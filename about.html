        <h1 class="name">Hey there! I'm Sahil Malawde, a computer science student 🖥️</h1>
        <p>
            I thrive on challenges—whether it's coding complex algorithms or plotting my next chess move. Chess is my passion; the 64 squares are my battlefield. 🤓♟️
            
            But life isn't all code and checkmates. I also love sports—running, swimming, you name it. The adrenaline rush keeps me going. 🏃‍♂️🏊‍♂️
            
            So, here's to the fusion of logic and strategy, bytes and boards. 🌟
        </p>
        <h1 class="name">Strengths:</h1>

        <p><li>Analytical Mindset: My brain thrives on logic and problem-solving. Whether its debugging code or unraveling a chess position, Im in my element.</li>
            <li>Adaptability: Im like a chameleon—quickly adjusting to new situations and technologies. Change doesnt faze me; it fuels me.</li>
            <li>Perseverance: When faced with a tough bug or a tricky chess endgame, I dont give up. I dig in, learn, and iterate until I conquer it.</li>
            <li>Team Player: Collaboration is my jam. I value diverse perspectives and believe that the best solutions emerge from collective effort.</li></p>
        
        <h1 class="name">Weaknesses:</h1>

        <li>Impatience: Sometimes, I want results yesterday. Waiting for code to compile or for that elusive checkmate? Not my strong suit.</li>
        <li>Overthinking: I can get lost in the intricacies. Balancing depth with practicality is a constant battle.</li>
        <li>Night Owl: My creative juices flow when the moon is out. But mornings? Not my peak performance time.</li>
        <li>Chess Obsession: Chess tactics invade my dreams. Its a blessing and a curse—I cant resist analyzing positions even during Netflix marathons.</li>
